# client-lib
Java REST Client Library

client-lib is a JAVA REST client library that is used by client-lib-android (https://github.com/SEI-AMS/client-lib-android) to interact with a Cloudlet Server using commands sent via a REST interface.

The easiest way to test changes to this library in cloudlet-client or a cloudlet-ready app, is to use the "gradlew install" command to install the changed library to a local Maven repo. This requires installing Maven first (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), in order to have the local .m2 repo in the system.

Cloudlets are discoverable, generic, stateless servers located in single-hop proximity of mobile devices, that can operate in disconnected mode and are virtual-machine (VM) based to promote flexibility, mobility, scalability, and elasticity. In our implementation of cloudlets, applications are statically partitioned into a very thin client that runs on the mobile device and a computation-intensive Server that runs inside a Service VM.
